Goal
I have to make a stunning ui ( pura creativity chod dena hay)

the ui has to be smooth has to be attractive and vibrant

resources to gather->
images ,
fonts

actions on user click scroll and tap->
I have to very carfull in this case and i have to determine the from before hand.
say some page appear delivaring some info
now for a user prospective it is common to scroll down
so i want to show some miraj animation of some bunch of imajes which will appear as user scroll down and stop(not stop actually the frection will increase a bit) when the section freedom scroll appear
again when some part of the f_s protion will disappear form the screen the frection will eaz uup and show some bunch of images to create miraj
question -- how many pictures are required to creact a good miraj ?

    	how to create the flow in dynamic vault?


    	whent user opens the page it will preloaded with the type and wait for 5 sec if user turn sthe nob than withing overall 3 sec animation the particular section(polity/tech / miselenious) with ui will appear

    	the animation will be like this the vault with the nob will pops and make a transform in the down and ultimately converge with a button.
    	the overall flow mush be smooth.
    	again to change the topic user have to click the right down boutton


    	UI is so far so good for 3:4 screen now i have to tackle 20:8 ratio screen
    	for 20:8 i think it will be best not to move the sticky background image insead of the movement change the opacity.
    	like when there is some text dropp its opacitty else make the opacity 1. also i think to make mobile usage work i just have to modify the main page contedns the other contains are already static (this is just a postulate).


    now i just have to  connect the server.
